# agile-workshop

Let's do a mini-sprint! <br/>
Our customers want a c program that can convert binary to base 10, and base 10 to binary.
<br/> <br/>
Our mini-sprint has 3 tasks, each team will take up a task on their respective branch, then we'll merge everything and see how we did!
<br/> <br/>
Edit dbc.c according to the instructions in the comments!
